# Use any AI you like

Sila is not tied to a single model or provider. You decide which AI services to use and can change them at any time.

## Bring your own keys

Connect OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other compatible API by supplying your own keys. Prefer running models yourself? Point Sila to a local server or to an open‑source model and keep everything on your hardware.

## Mix and match

Different tasks call for different strengths. Use a fast model for brainstorming, switch to a high‑quality model for final drafts, or run a local model when you need absolute privacy. Sila keeps track of your providers across workspaces so you can pick the best option for each conversation.

## Why it's better than ChatGPT

ChatGPT limits you to the models it offers and requires a subscription for premium options. Sila lets you experiment with the latest models or even run them for free on your own machine, all while owning the results.
