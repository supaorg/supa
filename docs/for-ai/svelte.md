New in SvelteKit 5:

# Runes

## Reactivity

Reactivity with `let x = "hello"` at component top-level is replaced with:

```js
let x: string = $state("hello")
```

This makes x reactive in the component, and also in any js functions that operate on it.

Don't use `$state<T>()` to pass the type. Always use `let x: Type =`. Variables declared with `let x = "hello"` are no longer reactive.

## Derived values

Old style:
```js
$: b = a + 1
```

New style:
```js
let b = $derived(a + 1)
```

Or for more complex use cases:
```js
let b = $derived.by(() => {
    // ... more complex logic
    return a + 1;
})
```

`$derived()` takes an expression. `$derived.by()` takes a function.

## Effect

```js
let a = $state(1);
let b = $state(2);
let c;

// This will run when the component is mounted, and for every updates to a and b.
$effect(() => {
    c = a + b;
});
```

Note: 
- Values read asynchronously (promises, setTimeout) inside `$effect` are not tracked.
- Values inside objects are not tracked directly inside `$effect`:

```js
// This will run once, because `state` is never reassigned (only mutated)
$effect(() => {
    state;
});

// This will run whenever `state.value` changes
$effect(() => {
    state.value;
});
```

An effect only depends on the values that it read the last time it ran.

```js
$effect(() => {
    if (a || b) {
        // ...
    }
});
```

If `a` was true, `b` was not read, and the effect won't run when `b` changes.

## Props

Old way to pass props to a component:
```js
export let a = "hello";
export let b;
```

New way:
```js
let {a = "hello", b, ...everythingElse} = $props()
```

`a` and `b` are reactive.

Types:
```js
let {a = "hello", b}: {a: string, b: number} = $props()
```

Note: Do NOT use this syntax for types:
```js
let { x = 42 } = $props<{ x?: string }>();  // ❌ Incorrect
```

# Slots and snippets

Instead of using `<slot />` in a component, you should now do:

```js
let { children } = $props()
// ...
{@render children()}  // This replaces <slot />
```

# Event Handling

In Svelte 5 the events do not use `on:event` syntax, they use `onevent` syntax.

In Svelte 5 `on:click` syntax is not allowed. Event handlers have been given a facelift in Svelte 5. Whereas in Svelte 4 we use the `on:` directive to attach an event listener to an element, in Svelte 5 they are properties like any other (in other words - remove the colon):

```svelte
<button onclick={() => count++}>
  clicks: {count}
</button>
```

`preventDefault` and `once` are removed in Svelte 5. Normal HTML event management is advised:

```svelte
<script>
  function once(fn) {
    return function(event) {
      if (fn) fn.call(this, event);
      fn = null;
    };
  }

  function preventDefault(fn) {
    return function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      fn.call(this, event);
    };
  }
</script>

<button onclick={once(preventDefault(handler))}>...</button>
```
